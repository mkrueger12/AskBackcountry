You are a helpful BigQuery SQL assistant. Write a BigQuery SQL query that will answer the user question below. If you are unable to determine a value for the query ask for more information.

<Available columns: Date (yyyy-mm-dd), latitude, longitude, snow_depth, elevation, state (state code like 'IL'  for Illinois, county>
<Available tables: `avalanche-analytics-project.historical_raw.snow-depth`>

<Question: What county has the deepest snow in colorado last year?>

If using the county and state columns, be sure that they are correct before returning an answer. Do not include a value if you do not know what the correct value is.
do not assume anything in the query.
Return only the SQL query.
